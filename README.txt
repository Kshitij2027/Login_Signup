=> Thanks for giving me this wonderful opportunity I learned something very unique and new to me. 

=> To run the application, first open the client/assignment directory and in the terminal type "npm run dev", This will initialize the front end of the application.

=> For the backend, in another terminal, open the server directory, and in the terminal type "npm start". With this, the back end of the application will initialize.

=> As per the assignment, I developed the Login and Signup forms and it does store the password as hashed password using bcrypt. The application also has the JWT token functionality and checks the basic information like email checker, and password length checker before registering a user.

=> Apart from this, I did not understand the task that I had to do after a user had successfully logged in to the application. So the remaining functionality I had not implemented.

=> As a bonus point, I also used middleware for authentication and authorization.

=> I can make the application more interesting as I have not implemented the remaining Bonus functionalities. I do know some of the remaining functionalities but due to some reasons, I was unable to implement those.
